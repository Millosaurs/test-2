### Branding & Site Config

- Use admin procedures to upsert site, hero, and features content:
  - `siteConfig.upsert`
  - `heroConfig.upsert`
  - `featuresConfig.upsert`
- Or build an admin UI calling these endpoints.

### Categories & Products

- Create/update categories with `categories.create/update`.
- Create/update products with `products.create/update`.
- Images can be uploaded via `images.upload` (Cloudinary required).

### Images (Cloudinary)

1. Get Cloudinary credentials (see Environment page).
2. Call `images.upload({ file: base64, folder?, filename? })` from an admin screen.
3. Store the returned `url` in your product or category.

### Support Content

- Use `support.config.upsert` to set hero/contact info.
- Manage FAQs via `support.faqCategories.*` and `support.faqs.*`.

### UI Components

- Modify components under `apps/web/src/components` and pages under `apps/web/src/app`.
- Tailwind styles live in `apps/web/src/index.css` and configured via Tailwind v4.

### Safety Tips

- Always run on a staging environment first.
- Lock down admin procedures with Better Auth admin roles.
