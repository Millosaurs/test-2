### Web cannot reach server

- Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` is set in `apps/web` to your server origin.
- If deploying on Vercel, set `CORS_ORIGIN` on the server to your web origin and redeploy.

### Auth not working

- Verify `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` and `BETTER_AUTH_URL` are set correctly.
- Make sure your browser is sending cookies; the oRPC client sets `credentials: include`.

### Database errors

- Verify `DATABASE_URL` is valid.
- Run `bun db:push` at the repo root to sync the schema.
- Check that your Postgres instance accepts external connections (if using Neon, ensure the project is active).

### Lemon Squeezy checkout fails

- Ensure your Lemon Squeezy environment variables are set and the API key has the correct permissions.
- Confirm that the Store and Generic Variant IDs match your Lemon Squeezy dashboard.

### Images not uploading

- Confirm Cloudinary credentials are set on the server.
- Ensure you pass a valid base64 data URL (e.g., `data:image/png;base64,...`).
